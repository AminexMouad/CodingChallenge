### Why i picked React framework

It's been a year since i started learning react , while I was learning react I developed many mini projects in react js .In 2018, I realized a mobile application using React-Native for my summer internship project. In 2019, I Realized my second mobile application using React-native with Redux, but this time I was comfortable using react, but my objective was to be a full Stack Javascript Developper so I was a MERN STACK ( MongoDB,ExpressJS,REACT,NodeJS).
